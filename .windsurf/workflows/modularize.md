START THE MIGRATION ONLY IF THERE ARE TESTS ALREADY INTEGRATED AND COVERAGE IS MORE THAN 70%; if not exit and do not proceed forward and ask user to implement tests first.

Migrate the whole codebase to a modular one; change the complete structure of the directories are per the standards for that specific framework. focus more on reusability and modularity. Make sure following:

1. SOLID principles are followed
2. DRY principles are followed.
3. Follows OOPS
4. Security considerations are met
5. Proper use of data structures for storage for minimal memory footprint.
