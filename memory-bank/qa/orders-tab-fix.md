# Orders Tab Fix - Transaction Analytics Page

## Issue Summary
The Orders tab on the transactions analytics page was not displaying any data. This was due to the recent implementation of category price inheritance for products, which introduced a mismatch between how cost prices were resolved in the TransactionAnalysisService and how they were accessed in the OrderList component.

## Root Cause
1. The `TransactionAnalysisService` was enhanced to use `CostPriceResolutionService` to resolve cost prices with inheritance
2. However, the resolved cost prices were not being stored on the transaction's product object
3. The `OrderList` component was still trying to access `product.costPrice` directly, which doesn't exist
4. Additionally, there were no proper type definitions for the resolved cost price on the Product interface

## Implemented Fix

### 1. TransactionAnalysisService
- Updated to store the resolved cost price on each transaction's product:
```typescript
// Get the resolved cost price and attach it to the product
const costPriceResolution = this.getResolvedCostPrice(sku);
      
// Add the resolved cost price to the transaction's product object
if (transaction.product) {
  transaction.product.resolvedCostPrice = costPriceResolution;
}
```

### 2. Type Definitions
- Extended the Product interface to include resolvedCostPrice:
```typescript
// Extend Product interface to support resolvedCostPrice
declare module "../services/product.service" {
  interface Product {
    resolvedCostPrice?: CostPriceResolution;
  }
}
```

### 3. OrderList Component
- Updated the component to use resolvedCostPrice instead of costPrice:
```typescript
const resolvedCostPrice = transaction.product.resolvedCostPrice?.value || 0;
const costPriceSource = transaction.product.resolvedCostPrice?.source || 'default';
```

- Added a source indicator column to show where the cost price came from:
```typescript
{
  id: 'costPriceSource',
  label: 'Price Source',
  filter: true,
  format: (value) => {
    const source = value as string;
    let textColor = 'inherit';
    if (source === 'product') textColor = '#1976d2';
    if (source === 'category') textColor = '#9c27b0';
    
    return (
      <span style={{ 
        fontWeight: source === 'default' ? 'normal' : 'bold', 
        color: textColor 
      }}>
        {source}
      </span>
    );
  }
}
```

## Verification
The fix was tested and verified to ensure:
1. Orders tab properly displays transaction data
2. Cost price sources are correctly shown
3. Calculations based on the resolved cost prices are accurate

## Additional Improvements
- Added visual indicators for cost price sources
- Added tooltips to explain the different price inheritance mechanisms
- Enhanced error handling for cases where cost price resolution fails

## Future Considerations
- Add unit tests specifically for the Orders tab functionality
- Consider standardizing the Product interface extensions across the codebase
- Add validation in the TransactionAnalysisService to ensure cost prices are always resolved before analysis
