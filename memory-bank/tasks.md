# Order Analytics Tab View Enhancement with Historical Data

## Task Overview
**Complexity Level:** Level 3 (Intermediate Feature)
**Status:** ✅ ARCHIVED  
**Mode:** ARCHIVE MODE COMPLETE

## Description
Add a tab view to the Order Analytics page with two tabs: "Overview" (existing functionality) and "Category Analytics" (new features). The Category Analytics tab will provide comprehensive category performance analysis with order count tracking, sorting capabilities, top 10 category identification, and today/yesterday comparison with visual indicators.
