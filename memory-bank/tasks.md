# TASK: Transaction Analytics Repair

## TASK OVERVIEW
**Objective**: Fix the transaction analytics table which is not working correctly and update it to use category price inheritance for products.

**Complexity Level**: 3 (Intermediate Feature)
**Type**: Bug Fix & Feature Enhancement
**Status**: COMPLETED ✅

## IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### 1. Issue Analysis
- [x] Examine the transaction analytics implementation and identify the main issues
  - Issue 1: TransactionAnalysisService does not integrate with CostPriceResolutionService
  - Issue 2: FlipkartFactory does not handle category-based pricing
  - Issue 3: Calculation errors in the analyze() method in TransactionAnalysisService
  - Issue 4: UI components not displaying correct data
- [x] Analyze the calculations in the TransactionAnalysisService
  - Direct usage of product.costPrice without inheritance logic
  - Incorrect profit calculations not considering quantity
- [x] Review the FlipkartFactory implementation for data processing
  - Missing category ID in product creation
  - Cost price hardcoded to 0
- [x] Verify the Flipkart import file structure and required fields
  - File confirmed as valid Excel format
  - Need to extract category information if available
- [x] Check how cost prices are currently integrated in the analytics
  - Direct access to product.costPrice without inheritance

### 2. Implementation Requirements
- [x] Update product price resolution to use category price inheritance
  - Integrate TransactionAnalysisService with CostPriceResolutionService
  - Use resolved cost prices instead of direct product.costPrice
- [x] Modify TransactionAnalysisService to use the correct cost price source
  - Add cost price resolution method
  - Make analyze() method async
  - Use resolved prices in calculations
- [x] Fix any calculation errors in the analytics service
  - Fix profit calculation to use resolved cost price × quantity
  - Ensure correct cost attribution in product summaries
- [x] Update the UI components to display the correct data
  - Add cost price source indication in UI
  - Ensure proper formatting of currency values
- [x] Ensure compatibility with imported data from Flipkart
  - Update FlipkartFactory to properly handle category IDs
  - Set customCostPrice to null to enable inheritance

### 3. Core Components
- [x] **TransactionAnalysisService updates**
  - [x] Add CostPriceResolutionService dependency to constructor
  - [x] Implement async resolveCostPrices() method
  - [x] Make analyze() method async
  - [x] Update calculation logic for costs and profits
  - [x] Add cost price source to analytics output
  - [x] Store resolved cost price on product object

- [x] **FlipkartFactory updates**
  - [x] Update rowToTransaction method to extract category ID
  - [x] Set customCostPrice to null in product creation
  - [x] Update sellingPrice calculation for products
  - [x] Add validation for required fields

- [x] **UI Components**
  - [x] Update product-list.component.tsx to display cost price source
  - [x] Fix order-list.component.tsx to use resolved cost price
  - [x] Add explanatory tooltips for price inheritance
  - [x] Improve currency formatting
  - [x] Update to handle async data flow

### 4. Testing Strategy
- [x] Test with sample Flipkart import file
  - Create test transactions with known category inheritance
  - Verify correct cost price resolution
- [x] Verify calculations against expected values
  - Create test cases with predefined cost prices
  - Manually verify profit calculations
- [x] Test cost price inheritance through categories
  - Test products with custom cost price
  - Test products inheriting from category
  - Test products with no valid cost price (default case)
- [x] Validate UI display of all values
  - Check proper formatting of currency values
  - Verify cost price source indication
  - Test tooltips and information displays
  - Fix Orders tab not displaying data

## PROGRESS TRACKING

## IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY
- Added CostPriceResolutionService integration to TransactionAnalysisService
- Implemented async price resolution with proper inheritance
- Fixed calculation logic to use quantity × resolved price
- Updated FlipkartFactory to extract category information and enable inheritance
- Enhanced UI components to display cost price sources
