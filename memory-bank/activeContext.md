# Active Context: PDF File Merging Enhancement

## Current Task
**Task:** PDF File Merging Enhancement: Pre-Merge Amazon and Flipkart Files
**Mode:** PLAN MODE
**Status:** Planning in Progress

## Task Overview
Enhance the PDF merger functionality to first merge all Amazon files into a single Amazon PDF and all Flipkart files into a single Flipkart PDF before passing them to the existing mergePDFs function.

## Current Focus
- **Planning Phase:** Creating detailed implementation plan for PDF consolidation
- **Complexity Level:** Level 3 (Intermediate Feature)
- **Primary Goal:** Improve PDF processing workflow by consolidating files by type before final merge

## Key Requirements
1. **Amazon Files Consolidation:** Merge multiple Amazon PDFs into single PDF
2. **Flipkart Files Consolidation:** Merge multiple Flipkart PDFs into single PDF
3. **Backward Compatibility:** Maintain existing functionality completely intact
4. **Error Handling:** Graceful handling of consolidation failures
5. **Performance:** Optimize for large file sets and memory usage

## Technical Approach
- Create new PDF consolidation service
- Update Redux slice with pre-merge step
- Integrate with existing PDFMergerService
- Maintain current transformer functionality
- Add comprehensive error handling

## Current Status
- ✅ Requirements analysis complete
- ✅ Technology stack validated
- ✅ Implementation planning complete
- ✅ Creative phase planning complete
- ⏳ Implementation phase pending

## Next Steps
1. Complete implementation planning ✅
2. Begin creative phase for PDF consolidation architecture ✅
3. Complete error handling strategy design ✅
4. Complete performance optimization design ✅
5. Implement PDF consolidation service
6. Update Redux slice with pre-merge functionality
7. Integrate with existing services
8. Add comprehensive testing
