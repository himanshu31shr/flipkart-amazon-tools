### Cost Price Resolution Logic
1. Product cost price resolution order:
   - Check product customCostPrice
   - If null, inherit from category costPrice
   - If category price null, use default price

### Data Migration Process
1. Backup existing data
2. Calculate average cost prices for categories
3. Update category cost prices
4. Reset product customCostPrice to null
5. Verify inheritance chain

### Testing Coverage
- Unit tests for CostPriceResolutionService
- Validation for price updates
- Error handling for edge cases
- Migration rollback functionality

## Deployment Instructions
1. Run migration script during off-peak hours
2. Monitor system during migration
3. Have rollback plan ready
4. Update documentation after successful migration
