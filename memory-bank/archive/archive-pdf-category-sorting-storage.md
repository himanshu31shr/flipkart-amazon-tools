## üìã Feature Summary

The PDF Category Sorting & Firebase Storage feature enhances the Sacred Sutra Tools application with three key capabilities:

1. **Category-Based PDF Sorting**: Organizes products in generated PDFs by category, with configurable sorting options
2. **Firebase Storage Integration**: Provides persistent storage for generated PDFs with metadata and expiration management
3. **Multiple File Upload Support**: Allows users to select or drag-and-drop multiple PDF files for processing

This feature addresses critical user needs for better-organized PDF outputs, the ability to access previously generated PDFs without regenerating them, and more efficient batch processing of multiple files.

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Sorting System**: `utils/pdfSorting.ts`
   - Multi-level category-based sorting algorithm
   - Configurable sort preferences (category, name, price, SKU)
   - Support for custom category ordering

2. **Storage Services**: 
   - `services/pdfStorageService.ts` - PDF-specific storage operations
   - `services/storage.service.ts` - Generic Firebase Storage interface

3. **UI Components**:
   - `SortPreferencesControl.tsx` - Sorting configuration interface
   - `StorageConfirmationDialog.tsx` - File storage options
   - `DownloadLinkDisplay.tsx` - Download management
   - `FileUploadSection.tsx` - Enhanced file upload with drag-and-drop
   - `FileInput.tsx` - Custom file input with multiple file support

4. **Configuration**:
   - `storage.rules` - Firebase Storage security rules
   - `firebase.config.ts` - Firebase initialization

### Data Models

```typescript
// Sort Configuration
interface CategorySortConfig {
  primarySort: 'category' | 'name' | 'price';
  secondarySort?: 'name' | 'price' | 'sku';
  sortOrder: 'asc' | 'desc';
  groupByCategory: boolean;
  categoryOrder?: string[]; // Optional manual category ordering
}

// Storage Configuration
interface StorageConfig {
  expiryDays: number;
  restrictAccess: boolean;
  isShared: boolean;
  visibility: 'private' | 'organization' | 'public';
  description?: string;
}

// PDF Metadata
interface PdfMetadata {
  userId: string;
  uploadedAt: number;
  expiresAt: number;
  originalFileName: string;
  fileSize: number;
  restrictAccess: boolean;
  isShared: boolean;
  visibility: string;
  storagePath?: string;
  stats?: {
    categoryCount?: number;
    productCount?: number;
    sortConfig?: CategorySortConfig;
  };
  description?: string;
}

// PDF Merger State
interface PdfMergerState {
  amazonFiles: File[]; // Array of Amazon PDF files
  flipkartFiles: File[]; // Array of Flipkart PDF files
  finalPdf: string | null;
  summary: ProductSummary[];
  loading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
}
```

### Storage Organization

Files are organized in Firebase Storage using the following structure:

```
pdfs/
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ userId/
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dd-mm-yyyy/
          ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ HH-MM-SS_filename.pdf
```

Where:
- `userId` is the authenticated user's ID
- `dd-mm-yyyy` is the date folder in day-month-year format
- `HH-MM-SS` is the time prefix in hours-minutes-seconds format
- `filename.pdf` is the sanitized file name

- Added visibility settings for future sharing features
- Created comprehensive security rules documentation
- Enhanced error handling with user-friendly messages

### 2. Infinite Upload Loop Issue

**Challenge**: PDFs were being repeatedly uploaded due to state management issues

**Solution**:
- Implemented proper state management with `processedPdfUrl`
- Added safeguards to prevent duplicate uploads
- Enhanced useEffect dependency arrays for better control flow
- Added loading state indicators to prevent multiple submissions

### 3. Folder Structure Complexity

**Challenge**: Initial nested YYYY/MM/DD folder structure was overly complex

**Solution**:
