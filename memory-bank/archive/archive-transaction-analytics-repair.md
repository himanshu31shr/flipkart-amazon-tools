# ARCHIVE: TRANSACTION ANALYTICS REPAIR

## Task Overview
**Objective**: Fix the transaction analytics table which was not working correctly and update it to use category price inheritance for products.

**Complexity Level**: 3 (Intermediate Feature)  
**Type**: Bug Fix & Feature Enhancement  
**Status**: COMPLETED ✅

**Time Period**: June 13, 2023 - June 18, 2023

## Implementation Summary
- Added CostPriceResolutionService integration to TransactionAnalysisService
- Implemented async price resolution with proper inheritance
- Fixed calculation logic to use quantity × resolved price
- Updated FlipkartFactory to extract category information and enable inheritance
- Enhanced UI components to display cost price sources
- Fixed Orders tab not displaying data by updating it to use resolvedCostPrice
  - Added analyzedTransactions array to TransactionSummary type
  - Modified TransactionAnalysisService to include analyzed transactions with resolved cost prices
  - Updated transactionAnalytics page to pass the analyzed transactions to the OrderList component
- Added visual indicators and tooltips explaining price inheritance
- Implemented proper error handling for price resolution

## Key Files Modified

- src/pages/transactionAnalytics/transactionAnalytics.page.tsx
- src/pages/transactionAnalytics/components/order-list.component.tsx

## Technical Documentation

### CostPriceResolution Integration
The TransactionAnalysisService now integrates with CostPriceResolutionService to properly resolve cost prices based on the following hierarchy:
1. Product's custom cost price (if set)
2. Category's cost price (if product belongs to a category with cost price)
3. Default fallback (0)

### Data Flow
The cost price resolution process follows these steps:
1. TransactionAnalysisService collects unique products from transactions
2. CostPriceResolutionService resolves cost prices for all products in batch
3. Resolved prices are stored in a Map for quick lookup
4. During analysis, each transaction's product is updated with its resolved cost price
5. Analyzed transactions are stored in the summary
6. UI components receive transactions with resolved cost prices

### Type Extensions
The Product interface was extended with a resolvedCostPrice property:
```typescript
interface Product {
  resolvedCostPrice?: CostPriceResolution;
}
```

The TransactionSummary type was extended with analyzedTransactions:
```typescript
interface TransactionSummary {
  // existing properties...
  analyzedTransactions?: Transaction[];
}
```

## Test Results Summary
All tests have been successfully completed:
- Unit tests for TransactionAnalysisService passed
- FlipkartFactory correctly extracts category information
- UI components properly display cost price sources
- Calculation accuracy verified for all test cases
- OrderList component correctly displays data using resolved cost prices
