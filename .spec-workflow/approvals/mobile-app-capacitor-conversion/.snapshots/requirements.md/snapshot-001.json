The mobile app will enable e-commerce sellers to manage their Amazon and Flipkart operations on-the-go, with an initial release focusing on three core features: Active Orders management, Products listing and search, and Categories/Category Groups management.\n\nThe conversion will leverage the existing React + Material-UI codebase through Capacitor, allowing for code reuse while providing native mobile experiences on iOS and Android platforms. This approach ensures rapid time-to-market while maintaining feature parity with the web application.\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nThis mobile conversion directly supports Sacred Sutra Tools' mission to streamline e-commerce operations for multi-platform sellers by:\n\n- **Extending Operational Efficiency**: Mobile access enables real-time order processing and inventory management from anywhere, supporting the goal of reducing manual processing time by 80%\n- **Enabling Remote Access**: Fulfills the \"Future Vision\" outlined in product.md by providing cloud-hosted dashboard access from mobile devices with role-based controls\n- **Supporting Scalability**: Mobile app allows businesses to handle increased order volumes without being tied to desktop workstations, supporting the 10x order volume handling objective\n- **Enhancing Collaboration**: Mobile access enables team members to manage inventory and process orders remotely, advancing the collaborative inventory management vision\n\n**Success Metrics Alignment**:\n- Maintain 95% accuracy in order processing on mobile devices\n- Achieve <2 second average response time for mobile dashboard queries\n- Enable 90% of critical workflows (orders, products, categories) on mobile in first release\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Requirement 1: Mobile App Infrastructure Setup\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want to set up Capacitor infrastructure for iOS and Android, so that our React web app can run as native mobile applications.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1.

Principle**: Mobile-specific components (e.g., MobileOrderCard, MobileProductList) should handle only mobile UI concerns, delegating business logic to existing services\n- **Modular Design**: Create `/mobile` subdirectories within feature folders for mobile-specific components while reusing services, store slices, and utilities\n- **Dependency Management**: Mobile components should not create new dependencies on external libraries; reuse existing Material-UI, Redux, and Firebase integrations\n- **Clear Interfaces**: Define mobile-specific prop interfaces that extend/adapt existing component interfaces for responsive behavior\n- **Code Reuse**: Maintain 90%+ code reuse by creating mobile view variants that wrap/compose existing components rather than duplicating logic\n\n### Performance\n\n- **Initial Load Time**: Mobile app SHALL load and become interactive within 3 seconds on mid-range devices (2-year-old phones)\n- **List Rendering**: Product and order lists SHALL render initial viewport within 1 second, with lazy loading for additional items\n- **Search Performance**: Search filtering SHALL provide results within 200ms for lists up to 1000 items\n- **Memory Usage**: App SHALL maintain memory footprint under 150MB during normal operation with up to 500 products/orders\n- **Bundle Size**: Mobile app bundle SHALL not exceed 5MB (excluding cached data) to ensure fast downloads and updates\n- **Navigation Transitions**: Page transitions SHALL complete within 300ms with smooth 60fps animations\n\n### Security\n\n- **Authentication**: SHALL use @capacitor-firebase/authentication with same security rules as web app (email/password, optional social login)\n- **Data Protection**: SHALL enforce Firestore security rules for user data isolation, preventing unauthorized access to other users' data\n- **Secure Storage**: SHALL use Capacitor SecureStorage plugin for storing authentication tokens and sensitive user preferences\n- **HTTPS Only**: All network communication SHALL use HTTPS/WSS protocols for data transmission\n- **Input Validation**: SHALL validate all user inputs on client-side before Firebase operations to prevent injection attacks\n- **Permission Handling**: SHALL request minimum necessary permissions (camera for barcode scanning) with clear user explanations\n\n### Reliability\n\n- **Offline Functionality**: SHALL provide 80% of core features (viewing cached orders/products, search/filter) without network connection\n- **Data Synchronization**: SHALL successfully sync 99% of offline changes when connection is restored, with conflict resolution\n- **Error Recovery**: SHALL gracefully handle and recover from network timeouts, Firebase errors, and device resource limitations\n- **Crash Prevention**: SHALL implement error boundaries to prevent component errors from crashing entire app\n- **State Persistence**: SHALL persist critical UI state (filters, selected date, navigation position) across app restarts\n- **Availability**: SHALL maintain same 99.9% uptime as web app through Firebase infrastructure\n\n### Usability\n\n- **Touch Interaction**: All interactive elements SHALL have minimum 44x44px touch targets per iOS Human Interface Guidelines\n- **Accessibility**: SHALL maintain WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance with screen reader support, color contrast ratios, and scalable text\n- **Responsive Design**: SHALL adapt to all mobile screen sizes from 320px (iPhone SE) to 428px (iPhone Pro Max) width\n- **Visual Feedback**: SHALL provide immediate visual feedback (ripple effects, state changes) for all user interactions within 100ms\n- **Loading States**: SHALL show skeleton screens or progress indicators for operations taking >500ms\n- **Error Messages**: SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages in user-friendly language with recovery options\n- **Onboarding**: SHALL provide optional tutorial/onboarding flow explaining mobile-specific features (barcode scanning, pull-to-refresh)\n\n### Compatibility\n\n- **iOS Support**: SHALL support iOS 13+ (covering 95%+ of iOS devices as of 2025)\n- **Android Support**: SHALL support Android 7.0+ (API level 24+, covering 95%+ of Android devices as of 2025)\n- **Device Types**: SHALL support phones (4\" to 7\" screens) with tablet optimization as future enhancement\n- **Browser Engine**: SHALL use platform WebView (WKWebView on iOS, Chrome WebView on Android)\n- **Firebase SDK**: SHALL use @capacitor-firebase plugins compatible with Firebase 11.6.1+\n- **Material-UI**: SHALL maintain compatibility with Material-UI 6.1.9+ responsive breakpoints and components\n\n### Testability\n\n- **Component Testing**: Mobile components SHALL have minimum 80% test coverage using React Testing Library\n- **Integration Testing**: Critical flows (order management, product search, category management) SHALL have end-to-end tests\n- **Device Testing**: SHALL test on minimum 3 physical devices per platform (iOS low/mid/high-end, Android low/mid/high-end)\n- **Network Testing**: SHALL test offline scenarios, slow network conditions, and connection loss/recovery\n- **Performance Testing**: SHALL measure and monitor metrics (load time, memory usage, FPS) on physical devices\n\n### Deployment and Distribution\n\n- **App Store Readiness**: SHALL meet Apple App Store and Google Play Store requirements for submission (metadata, screenshots, privacy policy)\n- **Update Mechanism**: SHALL support over-the-air updates for web content via Capacitor Live Updates or PWA refresh\n- **Native Updates**: SHALL provide process for publishing native app updates to app stores for Capacitor/plugin version bumps\n- **Version Management**: SHALL maintain version parity between web and mobile apps for Firebase schema compatibility\n- **Progressive Rollout**: SHALL support phased rollout (beta testing, staged release) to validate stability before wide release\n",
