The current barcode scanner implementation has several usability issues that impact the efficiency of order completion workflows. This enhancement focuses on improving scanner reliability, user feedback, session management, and multi-scan capabilities to create a more professional and efficient scanning experience.\n\nThe enhancements will transform the scanner from a single-use tool into a powerful batch processing interface, allowing users to complete multiple orders in a single session with better visual feedback and error prevention.\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nThis feature directly supports the Sacred Sutra Tools goal of **operational efficiency** by reducing manual order processing time and improving the accuracy of order completion workflows. The enhancements align with the **automation-first principle** by preventing user errors and streamlining repetitive scanning tasks.\n\nKey alignments with product objectives:\n- **Operational Efficiency**: Batch scanning capabilities reduce time spent opening/closing scanner modal\n- **Data Accuracy**: Throttling prevents duplicate scans and accidental order status changes\n- **User Experience**: Visual feedback and session logs improve confidence in scanning operations\n- **Scalability Support**: Multi-scan sessions enable handling higher order volumes efficiently\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Requirement 1: Scan Throttling and Debouncing\n\n**User Story:** As an order processor, I want the scanner to prevent duplicate scans of the same barcode, so that I don't accidentally mark the same order as completed multiple times.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN a barcode is successfully scanned THEN the system SHALL prevent scanning the same barcode for 3 seconds\n2. WHEN a user attempts to scan the same barcode within the throttle period THEN the system SHALL show a visual indicator that the scan was ignored\n3. WHEN the throttle period expires THEN the system SHALL allow the same barcode to be scanned again\n4. WHEN multiple different barcodes are scanned in quick succession THEN each scan SHALL be processed normally without throttling\n5. WHEN the scanner modal is closed and reopened THEN the throttle cache SHALL be cleared for a fresh session\n\n### Requirement 2: Visual Feedback for Successful Scans\n\n**User Story:** As an order processor, I want clear visual confirmation when a barcode is successfully scanned, so that I know the scan was processed correctly.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN a barcode is successfully scanned and processed THEN the system SHALL display a green success animation for 2 seconds\n2. WHEN a scan fails due to barcode not found THEN the system SHALL display a red error animation with the error message\n3. WHEN a scan is throttled/ignored THEN the system SHALL display an orange warning animation indicating \"Recently scanned\"\n4. WHEN the visual feedback is displayed THEN it SHALL include the scanned barcode ID and order information (if found)\n5. WHEN multiple scans occur rapidly THEN each feedback animation SHALL be queued and displayed sequentially\n\n### Requirement 3: Persistent Scanner Modal\n\n**User Story:** As an order processor, I want the scanner modal to remain open after scanning barcodes, so that I can scan multiple orders in one session without reopening the modal repeatedly.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN a barcode is successfully scanned and processed THEN the scanner modal SHALL remain open\n2. WHEN a scan fails due to errors THEN the scanner modal SHALL remain open\n3. WHEN the user clicks the close button or presses Escape THEN the modal SHALL close normally\n4. WHEN the scanner session has been active for more than 30 minutes THEN the system SHALL show an idle warning with option to continue or close\n5. WHEN the scanner modal remains open THEN it SHALL maintain its scanning state and camera permissions\n\n### Requirement 4: Session Scan History\n\n**User Story:** As an order processor, I want to see a list of barcodes I've scanned in the current session, so that I can track my progress and verify completed orders.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the scanner modal opens THEN it SHALL display an empty scan history list\n2. WHEN a barcode is successfully scanned THEN it SHALL be added to the session history with timestamp and order details\n3. WHEN a scan fails THEN it SHALL be added to the history with error status and reason\n4. WHEN a barcode is throttled THEN it SHALL be shown in history as \"Duplicate (ignored)\"\n5. WHEN the scan history has more than 10 items THEN it SHALL become scrollable with newest items at the top\n6. WHEN the scanner modal is closed THEN the session history SHALL be cleared (temporary session only)\n7. WHEN viewing the scan history THEN each entry SHALL show: barcode ID, scan time, status (success/error/ignored), and order product name (if available)\n\n### Requirement 5: Enhanced Camera Management\n\n**User Story:** As an order processor, I want the camera to remain active during my scanning session, so that I can scan multiple barcodes without waiting for camera initialization between scans.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the scanner modal opens THEN the camera SHALL initialize once and remain active throughout the session\n2. WHEN a barcode is scanned THEN the camera SHALL continue scanning for additional barcodes without interruption\n3. WHEN the scanner switches between camera and manual modes THEN the camera state SHALL be preserved appropriately\n4. WHEN the scanner modal is minimized or hidden THEN the camera SHALL pause to conserve resources\n5. WHEN the scanner modal regains focus THEN the camera SHALL resume without re-initialization\n\n### Requirement 6: Session Statistics\n\n**User Story:** As an order processor, I want to see summary statistics of my scanning session, so that I can track my productivity and completion progress.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the scanner modal is open THEN it SHALL display current session statistics: total scans, successful completions, errors, and duplicates ignored\n2. WHEN a scan is processed THEN the relevant statistics counter SHALL increment immediately\n3. WHEN the session statistics show successful completions THEN they SHALL be displayed with green success color\n4. WHEN the session statistics show errors THEN they SHALL be displayed with red error color\n5. WHEN the session has no activity for 5 minutes THEN the statistics SHALL show the idle time duration\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\n- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Separate components for scan throttling, visual feedback, session management, and scan history\n- **Modular Design**: Create reusable hooks for scan throttling, session state management, and camera lifecycle\n- **Dependency Management**: Minimize coupling between feedback animations and core scanning logic\n- **Clear Interfaces**: Define clean contracts between scanner components and Redux state management\n\n### Performance\n- **Throttling Efficiency**: Scan throttling mechanism must not impact scanner responsiveness for different barcodes\n- **Memory Management**: Session history and throttle cache must be memory-efficient for long scanning sessions\n- **Camera Resource Management**: Camera stream must be efficiently managed to prevent memory leaks during extended sessions\n- **Animation Performance**: Visual feedback animations must be smooth and not impact scanning performance\n\n### Security\n- **Session Data**: Session scan history must be temporary and not persist sensitive order information\n- **Camera Access**: Camera permissions and access must be managed securely throughout the session\n- **Throttle Cache**: Throttle data must be session-scoped and cleared when scanner modal closes\n\n### Reliability\n- **Error Recovery**: System must gracefully handle camera errors and scanning failures without breaking the session\n- **State Consistency**: Scanner state, session history, and statistics must remain consistent across all user interactions\n- **Memory Leaks**: No memory leaks from long-running scanner sessions or repeated modal open/close cycles\n\n### Usability\n- **Feedback Clarity**: Visual feedback must be clear, non-intrusive, and provide meaningful information to users\n- **Session Awareness**: Users must always understand their current session progress and scan history\n- **Accessibility**: All visual feedback and session information must be accessible via screen readers and keyboard navigation\n- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Enhanced scanner interface must work effectively on mobile devices and tablets",
