# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Barcode Order Completion feature enables automated tracking of order fulfillment through QR code generation and scanning. During PDF processing, the system generates unique QR codes for each order, embeds them into the printed labels, and provides a camera-based scanning interface for instant order completion marking. This eliminates manual order tracking, reduces fulfillment errors, and provides real-time visibility into order completion status.

This feature directly supports Sacred Sutra Tools' core mission of automating e-commerce operations for Amazon and Flipkart sellers by streamlining the final step in the order fulfillment process.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature strongly aligns with the key product principles outlined in product.md:

**Automation-First**: Eliminates manual order completion tracking through automated QR code generation and camera-based scanning, allowing users to focus on fulfillment rather than administrative tracking.

**Data Accuracy**: Ensures precise order completion tracking through unique barcode identification, preventing human errors in manual status updates and providing real-time completion visibility.

**Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle high-volume order processing with efficient QR code generation during PDF processing and fast database lookups during scanning, supporting business growth without proportional administrative overhead.

**Operational Efficiency**: Reduces order completion workflow time by 80% through instant scanning-based completion marking, contributing to the overall goal of processing 10x order volume without proportional staffing increases.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Automated Barcode Generation

**User Story:** As an e-commerce seller, I want unique QR codes generated for each order during PDF processing, so that I can track order completion without manual data entry.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads Amazon or Flipkart PDF files THEN the system SHALL generate a unique barcode ID for each order using format BC_YYYY-MM-DD_XXX
2. WHEN generating barcode IDs THEN the system SHALL ensure uniqueness through collision detection and sequential numbering within each date
3. WHEN processing orders THEN the system SHALL create barcode tracking records in a new Firestore collection 'order-barcodes' with order metadata
4. WHEN barcode generation fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue processing other orders without blocking the entire batch
5. WHEN generating barcodes THEN the system SHALL maintain processing performance with less than 2 seconds additional time per PDF batch

### Requirement 2: QR Code PDF Embedding

**User Story:** As an e-commerce seller, I want QR codes embedded in my printed order labels, so that I can scan them during fulfillment to mark orders complete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing PDF files THEN the system SHALL embed QR codes into each page at a consistent position (bottom-left corner, minimum viable size for reliable scanning)
2. WHEN embedding QR codes THEN the system SHALL maintain existing PDF quality and layout without overlapping critical information
3. WHEN generating QR codes THEN the system SHALL encode the barcode ID as plain text for reliable scanning across devices
4. WHEN PDF embedding fails for a page THEN the system SHALL log the error but continue processing remaining pages
5. WHEN processing large PDFs THEN the system SHALL handle memory efficiently to prevent browser crashes

### Requirement 3: Camera-Based Order Scanning

**User Story:** As an e-commerce seller, I want to scan QR codes with my device camera to instantly mark orders as completed, so that I can track fulfillment progress in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the barcode scanner THEN the system SHALL activate the device camera with appropriate permissions handling
2. WHEN a QR code is detected THEN the system SHALL extract the barcode ID and perform database lookup within 500ms
3. WHEN a valid barcode is found THEN the system SHALL mark the order as completed with timestamp and user identification
4. WHEN an invalid or already-completed barcode is scanned THEN the system SHALL display appropriate feedback without errors
5. WHEN camera is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide manual barcode entry as a fallback option
6. WHEN scanning on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL provide responsive interface optimized for various screen sizes

### Requirement 4: Order Completion Status Management

**User Story:** As an e-commerce seller, I want to see which orders are completed and which are pending, so that I can prioritize my fulfillment workflow and track progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing Today's Orders THEN the system SHALL display clear completion status indicators for each order
2. WHEN an order is marked complete THEN the system SHALL update the UI in real-time without requiring page refresh
3. WHEN filtering orders THEN the system SHALL provide options to view completed, pending, or all orders
4. WHEN displaying order lists THEN the system SHALL show completion timestamps and user who completed each order
5. WHEN orders are completed THEN the system SHALL maintain completion data integrity between barcode collection and orders array

### Requirement 5: Integration with Existing Order Management

**User Story:** As an e-commerce seller, I want barcode completion to work seamlessly with my existing order management workflow, so that I don't need to change my current processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing PDFs with existing order data THEN the system SHALL add barcode fields without affecting current order structure
2. WHEN using existing Today's Orders features THEN all current functionality SHALL remain unchanged (filtering, grouping, analytics)
3. WHEN orders have completion status THEN the system SHALL sync data between barcode collection and active-orders collection
4. WHEN viewing order analytics THEN completion data SHALL be included in existing reports and dashboards
5. WHEN system fails THEN order processing SHALL continue without barcodes rather than blocking entire workflow

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Barcode service handles only barcode operations, PDF embedding utilities handle only PDF manipulation, scanner component handles only scanning interface
- **Modular Design**: BarcodeService extends FirebaseService following existing patterns, scanner component is self-contained with clear props interface
- **Dependency Management**: Barcode functionality integrates with existing merge.service.ts without creating circular dependencies
- **Clear Interfaces**: Define TypeScript interfaces for OrderBarcode, BarcodeGenerationResult, and ScanningResult with comprehensive type safety

### Performance
- **Barcode Generation**: Complete barcode generation for typical order batch (20-50 orders) within 2 seconds additional processing time
- **QR Code Scanning**: Recognition and database lookup complete within 500ms for responsive user experience
- **PDF Processing**: Memory-efficient embedding that handles PDFs up to 100 pages without browser memory issues
- **Database Operations**: Barcode lookup queries execute within 100ms using direct document access patterns
- **UI Responsiveness**: Real-time completion status updates reflect within 50ms of scanning action

### Security
- **Data Privacy**: Barcode IDs contain no sensitive information (only date and sequence number)
- **Authentication**: All barcode operations require user authentication through existing Firebase Auth
- **Database Security**: Firestore security rules prevent unauthorized access to barcode collection with user-based isolation
- **Input Validation**: All scanned barcode data validated before database operations to prevent injection attacks
- **Error Handling**: Failed operations logged securely without exposing sensitive system information

### Reliability
- **Error Recovery**: PDF processing continues if individual barcode generation fails, with clear error reporting
- **Data Consistency**: Master completion status maintained in barcode collection with eventual consistency sync to orders
- **Offline Handling**: Scanner gracefully handles network failures with appropriate user feedback
- **Browser Compatibility**: Camera functionality works across modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) with appropriate fallbacks
- **Concurrent Operations**: Multiple users can scan orders simultaneously without data conflicts

### Usability
- **Mobile Optimization**: Scanner interface optimized for mobile devices commonly used in warehouse/fulfillment environments
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear success/error indicators during scanning with appropriate animations and color coding
- **Accessibility**: Scanner component follows WCAG guidelines for users with disabilities
- **Error Messages**: User-friendly error messages for common scenarios (camera denied, invalid barcode, network issues)
- **Learning Curve**: Feature integrates seamlessly with existing workflow requiring minimal user training
