# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for converting the Sacred Sutra Tools web application into a native mobile application using Capacitor. The mobile app will enable e-commerce sellers to manage their Amazon and Flipkart operations on-the-go, with an initial release focusing on three core features: Active Orders management, Products listing and search, and Categories/Category Groups management.

The conversion will leverage the existing React + Material-UI codebase through Capacitor, allowing for code reuse while providing native mobile experiences on iOS and Android platforms. This approach ensures rapid time-to-market while maintaining feature parity with the web application.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This mobile conversion directly supports Sacred Sutra Tools' mission to streamline e-commerce operations for multi-platform sellers by:

- **Extending Operational Efficiency**: Mobile access enables real-time order processing and inventory management from anywhere, supporting the goal of reducing manual processing time by 80%
- **Enabling Remote Access**: Fulfills the "Future Vision" outlined in product.md by providing cloud-hosted dashboard access from mobile devices with role-based controls
- **Supporting Scalability**: Mobile app allows businesses to handle increased order volumes without being tied to desktop workstations, supporting the 10x order volume handling objective
- **Enhancing Collaboration**: Mobile access enables team members to manage inventory and process orders remotely, advancing the collaborative inventory management vision

**Success Metrics Alignment**:
- Maintain 95% accuracy in order processing on mobile devices
- Achieve <2 second average response time for mobile dashboard queries
- Enable 90% of critical workflows (orders, products, categories) on mobile in first release

- **Modular Design**: Create `/mobile` subdirectories within feature folders for mobile-specific components while reusing services, store slices, and utilities
- **Dependency Management**: Mobile components should not create new dependencies on external libraries; reuse existing Material-UI, Redux, and Firebase integrations
- **Clear Interfaces**: Define mobile-specific prop interfaces that extend/adapt existing component interfaces for responsive behavior
- **Code Reuse**: Maintain 90%+ code reuse by creating mobile view variants that wrap/compose existing components rather than duplicating logic

- **Data Synchronization**: SHALL successfully sync 99% of offline changes when connection is restored, with conflict resolution
- **Error Recovery**: SHALL gracefully handle and recover from network timeouts, Firebase errors, and device resource limitations
