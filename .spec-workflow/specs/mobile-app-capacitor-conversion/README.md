# Mobile App Capacitor Conversion - Specification Complete

**Status**: ✅ **Ready for Implementation**
**Approved**: 2025-10-03
**Implementation Tracking**: [tasks.md](./tasks.md)

## Overview

This specification defines the conversion of Sacred Sutra Tools web application into a native mobile application using Capacitor 6. The mobile app will enable e-commerce sellers to manage Amazon and Flipkart operations on-the-go.

## Specification Documents

### 1. Requirements ([requirements.md](./requirements.md))
**Status**: ✅ Approved

Defines WHAT to build with:
- **9 Core Requirements**: Infrastructure setup, responsive UI, mobile-friendly components, Active Orders page, Products page, Categories pages, offline support, mobile navigation, code quality
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Code architecture, performance, security, reliability, usability, compatibility, testability, deployment
- **Key User Additions**:
  - Mobile-friendly common components (DataTable, filters, modals, date pickers, etc.)
  - Mandatory testing standards (zero TypeScript errors, zero ESLint errors, 80%+ coverage)

### 2. Design ([design.md](./design.md))
**Status**: ✅ Approved

Defines HOW to build with:
- **Capacitor Hybrid Architecture**: Native container + WebView for 95%+ code reuse
- **7 Core Components**: Capacitor config, Firebase integration, mobile navigation, responsive DataTable, mobile pages
- **Responsive Component Pattern**: Material-UI breakpoints with conditional rendering
- **Error Handling**: 7 error scenarios with recovery strategies
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit, integration, E2E, and device testing requirements

### 3. Tasks ([tasks.md](./tasks.md))
**Status**: ✅ Approved

Implementation plan with:
- **66 Atomic Tasks** organized in 9 phases
- **9 Phases**: Setup (10 tasks), Firebase (6 tasks), Infrastructure (8 tasks), Components (10 tasks), Orders (6 tasks), Products (5 tasks), Categories (5 tasks), Testing (8 tasks), Deployment (8 tasks)
- Each task includes:
  - File paths to create/modify
  - _Leverage: Existing code to reuse
  - _Requirements: Links to requirements
  - _Prompt: Detailed implementation guidance with Role, Task, Restrictions, Success criteria

## Technology Summary

**Approach**: Capacitor 6 hybrid architecture (chosen over React Native and PWA-only)

**Key Technologies**:
- Capacitor 6 for native iOS/Android containers
- @capacitor-firebase/* plugins for native Firebase SDKs
- Material-UI 6.1.9 with responsive breakpoints
- Existing React 18 + TypeScript + Redux stack (95% reusable)

**Target Platforms**:
- iOS 13+ (native app via App Store)
- Android 7.0+ / API 24+ (native app via Play Store)

**First Release Features** (MVP):
1. Active Orders page with barcode scanning
2. Products list and search
3. Categories and Category Groups management

## Implementation Notes

### Code Organization
Mobile components follow the `/mobile` subdirectory pattern:
```
pages/[feature]/
├── [Feature]Page.tsx           # Desktop/web version
└── mobile/
    ├── Mobile[Feature]Page.tsx # Mobile version
    └── components/             # Mobile-specific sub-components
```

### Quality Requirements
Before marking any task complete:
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes (`npm run type-check`)
- ✅ ESLint passes (`npm run lint`)
- ✅ All tests pass with 80%+ coverage (`npm run test`)
- ✅ Mobile responsive tests pass (320px, 375px, 428px viewports)

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: 80% minimum coverage for new mobile components
- **Integration Tests**: Order management, product search, category management flows
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright with device emulation for critical user journeys
- **Device Testing**: Minimum 3 physical devices per platform (low/mid/high-end)

## Documentation Updates

The following steering and development documents have been updated to reflect mobile architecture:

### Updated Files
1. **CLAUDE.md** - Added mobile development commands, architecture overview, testing requirements
2. **.spec-workflow/steering/tech.md** - Added Capacitor, mobile technologies, performance requirements, compatibility
3. **.spec-workflow/steering/structure.md** - Added mobile component organization, responsive patterns, testing structure

## Next Steps

1. **Begin Task 1**: Install Capacitor core packages and CLI
2. **Follow Task Sequence**: Implement tasks sequentially, completing all quality checks
3. **Track Progress**: Use tasks.md checkboxes to track completion
4. **Quality Gates**: Ensure zero errors and passing tests before marking tasks complete
