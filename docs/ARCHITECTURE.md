## State Management

### Global State (Redux)
- **Slices**: Organized by feature (auth, products, orders, etc.)
- **RTK Query**: For data fetching and caching, integrated with Firebase services.
- **Persistence**: Using Redux Persist for persisting state locally.

### Local State
- **React Hooks**: For component-level state (`useState`, `useReducer`).
- **Context API**: For shared state across components where Redux might be overkill.

## Data Flow

1. **Data Fetching**
   - Components use RTK Query hooks (or sometimes direct service calls for non-cached data) to fetch data.
   - RTK Query handles caching, loading states, and error handling for API interactions.
   - Data from Firebase services is processed and stored in the Redux store.

2. **Data Updates**
   - Mutations are performed through RTK Query (or direct service calls).
   - Optimistic updates are used where appropriate for better UX.
   - Automatic cache invalidation is managed by RTK Query.

## Authentication

### Flow
1. User interacts with authentication components (e.g., Login page).
2. Authentication details are sent to Firebase Authentication via `AuthService`.
3. On successful authentication, Firebase provides user data and tokens.
4. User data and authentication status are stored in the Redux store.
5. `ProtectedRoutes` components check the authentication status from the Redux store to control access to routes.

### Security
- Authentication is primarily handled by **Firebase Authentication**.
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)** is implemented, likely enforced via Firebase Security Rules and frontend route protection.
- **JWT tokens** are managed by Firebase for session management.
- Secure handling of sensitive data and environment variables.

## API Layer

### Firebase Services
- Authentication: Managed by Firebase Authentication.
- Firestore (NoSQL database): Used for storing structured application data.
- Storage (for file uploads): Used for storing files like product images or uploaded data files.
- Cloud Functions (for serverless backend logic): Used for tasks that require backend processing or access to Firebase Admin SDK.

### Application Services
- Located in the `src/services/` directory.
- Act as an intermediary layer between UI components and Firebase services.
- Contain business logic and data transformation.
- Examples: `product.service.ts`, `transaction.service.ts`, `category.service.ts`, `firebase.service.ts` (a base service for Firebase interactions).

## Performance Considerations

### Code Splitting
- **Route-based code splitting** is implemented using React Router's lazy loading.
- **Dynamic imports** are used for other potentially heavy components or modules.

### Optimization Techniques
- **React.memo**, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` are used to prevent unnecessary re-renders and optimize calculations.
- **Pagination** is implemented in the `DataTable` component to handle large datasets efficiently.
- **Optimized Firebase queries** with proper indexing to minimize read times.
- **Caching mechanisms** (via RTK Query and potentially service worker) to reduce redundant data fetching.
- Consideration for **virtualized lists** for extremely large datasets in the future.

## Security

### Frontend Security
- **Input validation** is performed on user inputs.
- Measures are taken to mitigate common web vulnerabilities like **XSS** and **CSRF**.

### Backend Security (Firebase)
- **Firebase Security Rules** are crucial for enforcing data access control and validation in Firestore and Storage.
- Authentication requirements are enforced for accessing protected data and resources.
- Data validation can also be reinforced at the backend level using Firebase Security Rules or Cloud Functions.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- **React Testing Library** is used for testing React components.
- **Jest** is used for testing utilities, Redux reducers, and service logic.
- **Mocking Firebase services** and external dependencies to isolate unit tests.

### Integration Testing
- Testing interactions between components.
- Testing the integration of components with the Redux store and services.

### End-to-End (E2E) Testing
- **Cypress** can be used for automating tests of critical user flows in the browser.

## Deployment

### Environments
- Development
- Staging
- Production

### CI/CD
- **GitHub Actions** are used for automated testing and deployment workflows.
- **Automated versioning** with tools like semantic-release can be integrated.
- **Preview deployments** for pull requests facilitate testing of changes before merging.
