# Multi-Category Tagging and Sidesheet Feature

## Overview
This feature allows users to:
- Select multiple or all categories in the category table.
- Apply tags to selected categories in bulk.
- View the number of products in each category directly in the table.
- Click a category row to open a sidesheet displaying all products in that category.

## UI/UX Changes
- **Category Table**: Adds a checkbox column for multi-select and a product count column.
- **Bulk Tagging**: An "Apply Tag" button appears when categories are selected. Clicking it opens a dialog to choose or enter a tag, which is then applied to all selected categories.
- **Sidesheet**: Clicking a category row (not the checkbox) opens a sidesheet with a paginated list of products for that category.

## Technical Design
- **DataTable**: Extended to support row selection (checkboxes) and select-all.
- **Category Data**: Uses `CategoryInventoryService.getAllCategoriesWithInventory()` to get product counts.
- **Bulk Tag Update**: Batch update logic for category tags.
- **Product Sidesheet**: New component to fetch and display products by category using `ProductService.getProducts({ categoryId })`.

## Affected Files
- `src/pages/categories/CategoryList.tsx`
- `src/components/DataTable/DataTable.tsx`
- `src/components/DataTable/TableHeader.tsx`
- `src/components/DataTable/TableRowComponent.tsx`
- `src/pages/categories/ProductSidesheet.tsx` (new)
- `src/services/categoryInventory.service.ts`
- `src/services/product.service.ts`

## Best Practices
- Checkbox selection should not interfere with row click for sidesheet.
- All UI changes should be accessible and mobile-friendly.
- Batch updates should handle errors gracefully.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Extend DataTable for Multi-Select**
   - Add checkbox column and select-all logic in `DataTable`, `TableHeader`, and `TableRowComponent`.
2. **Refactor CategoryList**
   - Use `getAllCategoriesWithInventory()` for product count.
   - Add state for selected categories.
   - Add "Apply Tag" button and dialog for bulk tagging.
   - Integrate sidesheet opening on row click.
3. **Create ProductSidesheet Component**
   - Fetch and display products for a category.
   - Paginate if needed.
4. **Batch Update Logic**
   - Use service/store logic to update tags for multiple categories.
5. **Testing & Documentation**
   - Add/extend tests for new UI and logic.
   - Update docs and README as needed.

**Next: Begin implementation with DataTable multi-select support.**
## DataTable Multi-Select Implementation Notes

- Added a checkbox column to the DataTable for multi-select support.
- TableHeader now includes a select-all checkbox.
- TableRowComponent includes a checkbox for each row.
- DataTable manages selected row state and provides selection handlers to header and rows.
- MobileDataRow will not support multi-select for now (desktop only), but can be extended later if needed.
- All changes are backward compatible for tables not using selection.

Next: Implement the code changes for DataTable multi-select support.
## UI/UX Improvements (Latest Update)

### Fixed Design Issues
- **Table Layout**: Fixed broken table design by placing the select-all checkbox in the same row as column headers instead of a separate row.
- **Inline Tag Application**: Replaced modal-based tag application with an inline interface that appears above the table when categories are selected.

### Enhanced Category Management Page
- **Modern Header**: Improved page title with better typography and primary color styling.
- **Inline Bulk Actions**: Clean interface with Autocomplete for tag selection, supporting both existing and new tags.
- **Visual Feedback**: Selected categories count is displayed, with options to apply tags or clear selection.
- **Paper Components**: Data table wrapped in Paper component for better visual separation.
- **Responsive Layout**: Better spacing and responsive design throughout the page.

### Enhanced Product Sidesheet
- **Search Functionality**: Added real-time search across product name, SKU, and description.
- **Card-based Layout**: Replaced list view with modern card design for better readability.
- **Stock Status Indicators**: Visual badges showing stock levels (In Stock, Low Stock, Out of Stock) with appropriate colors.
- **Better Information Hierarchy**: Improved typography and spacing for product information.
- **Pagination Improvements**: Added first/last page buttons and better pagination controls.
- **Empty State**: Better empty state design with icons and helpful messaging.

### Technical Improvements
- **Autocomplete Integration**: Supports both selecting existing tags and creating new ones.
- **State Management**: Proper state clearing and refresh after bulk operations.
- **Performance**: Optimized product filtering with useMemo for search functionality.
- **Accessibility**: Better ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support.

**Status: ‚úÖ Feature Complete and Polished**## Redux Integration Update

### ProductSidesheet Redux Refactoring
- **Replaced Direct Service Calls**: ProductSidesheet no longer calls ProductService directly
- **Added Redux Actions**: New `fetchProductsByCategory` async thunk for fetching products by category
- **Enhanced ProductsState**: Added `categoryProducts`, `categoryProductsLoading`, and `categoryProductsError` fields
- **State Management**: Added `clearCategoryProducts` action to clean up state when sidesheet closes
- **Selectors**: Added dedicated selectors for category-specific product data

### Technical Benefits
- **Centralized State**: All product data now flows through Redux store
- **Better Caching**: Products fetched by category are cached in Redux state
- **Consistent State Management**: Unified approach across the application
- **Improved Performance**: Eliminates redundant API calls and provides better state synchronization
- **Better Error Handling**: Centralized error handling through Redux middleware

### Implementation Details
- **fetchProductsByCategory**: Fetches products for a specific category ID
- **clearCategoryProducts**: Clears category-specific products when sidesheet closes
- **Proper Cleanup**: State is properly cleaned up to prevent memory leaks
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper typing throughout
