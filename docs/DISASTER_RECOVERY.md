- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal access required for recovery

#### Data Protection
```bash
# SECURE RECOVERY PROCEDURES

# Verify user credentials before granting emergency access
gh auth status

# Use secure communication channels
export RECOVERY_CHANNEL="secure-disaster-recovery"

# Log all recovery actions
echo "$(date): [USER] executed [ACTION]" >> /secure/dr-audit.log

# Verify system integrity after recovery
npm audit
git fsck
```

#### Incident Response Integration
- **Security Team Notification**: Automatic notification for security-related disasters
- **Forensic Preservation**: Preserve evidence during security incidents
- **Compromise Assessment**: Evaluate security impact of disasters

## 📋 Recovery Testing Protocols

### Pre-Test Preparation

#### Environment Setup
```bash
# DISASTER RECOVERY TEST PREPARATION

# Create isolated test environment
export DR_TEST_ENV="dr-test-$(date +%Y%m%d)"

# Backup current state
git tag "dr-test-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)"

# Prepare test data
npm run generate:test-data

# Notify team of test
echo "DR Test starting: $(date)" | notify-team
```

#### Test Execution
```bash
# TEST EXECUTION FRAMEWORK

# Record test start
echo "DR Test Start: $(date)" > dr-test-results.txt

# Execute test scenario
./run-dr-test-scenario.sh [SCENARIO_NUMBER]

START_TIME=$(date +%s)
# ... recovery procedures ...
END_TIME=$(date +%s)
RECOVERY_TIME=$((END_TIME - START_TIME))

# Document results
echo "Recovery Time: ${RECOVERY_TIME}s" >> dr-test-results.txt
```

#### Post-Test Analysis
```bash
# POST-TEST ANALYSIS

# Compare against RTO objectives
if [ $RECOVERY_TIME -lt 300 ]; then
  echo "✅ RTO Objective Met: ${RECOVERY_TIME}s < 300s"
else
  echo "❌ RTO Objective Missed: ${RECOVERY_TIME}s > 300s"
fi

# Document lessons learned
echo "Lessons Learned:" >> dr-test-results.txt
